# musicplayer-react-native

## What Is The Project

This is a music streaming application I built using react-native for a tutorial that I wrote on my blog. You can play a song through a url.

Actions you can take on the song: 
* Play/Pause the song
* Seek the song
* Control the song from lockscreen/notification panel
